### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: We will use React for the frontend, taking advantage of its component-based architecture and ability to manage state for responsive and dynamic UI. Tailwind CSS will provide utility-first styling to make it easier to implement responsive designs and Radix UI will give us unstyled, fully accessible UI primitives to utilize.
- **Backend**: We will be using Next.js for its powerful server-side rendering capabilities. This will handle user requests and facilitate interactions with the AI (either by calling an API or a serverless function).
- **AI Engine**: The AI engine could be a custom built solution or leveraging pre-existing AI/ML models or services (like GPT-3). The AI will parse user commands and return the appropriate components or data to be displayed.

### Pseudocode
```
1. Initialize the page with a simple command palette.
2. User enters a command in the command palette.
3. Pass the command to the AI engine.
4. AI parses the command and determines the appropriate response (component/data).
5. AI returns the response to the Next.js server.
6. The server sends the response to the client-side.
7. React captures the response in state and re-renders the necessary components.
8. User views the output on their screen.
9. Repeat steps 2-8 for each user command.
```

### Sample Code

This is a simplified example and might not include all necessary details or best practices. It's simply a high-level representation of how the interaction could be structured. 

Let's suppose the AI Engine is a serverless function deployed on Vercel. The command is sent as a request to the function, which parses the command and returns the appropriate JSX to be rendered.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Box, TextInput } from '@radix-ui/react';

const CommandPalette = () => {
  const [command, setCommand] = useState('');
  const [output, setOutput] = useState(null);

  const handleCommandChange = (e) => {
    setCommand(e.target.value);
  };

  const handleCommandSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    const response = await fetch('/api/ai-engine', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ command }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    setOutput(data.component);
  };

  return (
    <Box>
      <form onSubmit={handleCommandSubmit}>
        <TextInput 
          value={command}
          onChange={handleCommandChange}
          placeholder="Enter command"
        />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
      {output && output}
    </Box>
  );
};

export default CommandPalette;
```

In this example, the TextInput from Radix UI is used for the command palette and the user command is sent to an AI engine (simulated here as a Next.js API route). The AI engine would return a component or data to be rendered which is then stored in state and rendered.

Please note that integrating AI to interpret commands and generate components is a complex task that goes beyond the scope of this example. This involves working with AI models and potentially generating dynamic React components which should be done with caution due to potential security implications.
